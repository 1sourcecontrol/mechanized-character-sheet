                    Play during combat proceeds in turns with one player after another. During 
                    your turn, you may do one of the following five plays: move then attack, 
                    or attack then move, or idle which is neither moving nor attacking. You may
                    also move without attacking or attack without moving. 
                </p>
                <p class="hint">
                    Some tabletop games allow you to split your move action, allowing you to move,
                    then attack, then move again. In Mechanized, this requires a unique subsystem.

        <h2>Moving</h2>
        <div class="subsystemPanel">
            <div class="subsystem">
                <p class="rules"> 
                    Each Mech has a movement drive, which gives a speed measured in 
                    spaces. On each of your turns, if you chose to move, you may move
                    up to that number of spaces on unobstructed terrrain. For example,
                    if you have a move speed of 3, you could follow the red path pictured
                    to the right.
                </p>
                <p class="rules"> 
                    Some Terrain obstructs your movement, which means that it costs 
                    more of your speed to move through it. For example, the light 
                    forest pictured in the gold path to the right penalizes movement
                    by 1 extra movement. As shown, the mech with a move speed of 3 
                    can only move 2 hexes along the gold path, since moving through 
                    the light forest took an extra space. Some terrain requires even
                    more movement than 1 extra to move through. See the Terrain Guide
                    rules page for specifics.

                <p class="rules"> 
                    As long as you have some amount of movement left at the end of your
                    move, you can use it up to enter a hex of passable terrain. Consider
                    the third step along the purple path shown to the right. Though
                    the mech only has a speed of 3, and even though the mech used 2 of
                    its 3 speed getting to that second hex, it can still move into that
                    light forest as long as it ends its movement there. 
                </p>
                <p class="rules"> 
                    See the Terrain Guide page for specific details on the penalties
                    or bonuses to movement that each kind of terrain provides.
                </p>
                <p class="hint"> 
                    Different terrain offers different penalties not only to movement,
                    but also to your accuracy and evasion. Where you move to can often be the 
                    difference between victory or blowing up! If you want your mech to move faster,
                    you can buy upgrades to your movement drive subsystem during the build phase.

                <p class="rules">
                    To attack another player's mech, choose which weapon you are attacking with,
                    then choose which mech you are attacking. Roll a for accuracy, and add up 
                    your bonuses and penalties. See the "Rolling 
                    for Accuracy Section" to see if you hit or not. If you hit, then you roll 
                    for damage. See the "rolling for damage" section below. You can attack with 
                    each of your weapons each turn. You may not attack with a weapon twice on a 
                    turn. You may decide not to use a weapon on a turn, for example if you wish
                    to preserve ammunition.

                <p class="rules">
                    To find out if your attack hit your opponenet, roll a 12 sided dice (often 
                    abreviated as d12) then add up all of your bonuses to accuracy and subtract
                    all of your penalties (sometimes called "maluses"). Look the resulting number
                    up on the accuracy scale below. If the number is below 5, then your attack
                    misses, and you deal no damage. If the number calculated is higher than 4, 
                    then your attack hit, and you get to roll damage (See the "roll for damage 
                    section next"). If the calculated number is higher than 7, then not only did 
                    you hit, but you were accurate enough to hit a weak point in your target's armor!
                    The numbers in the accuracy table below show how much extra damage EACH DICE you 
                    roll for damage gains.

                    If Alice is shooting Bob with a Large Proton Laser, which deals 2d6 damage,
                    and she rolls a 10, which has a +2 damage per dice bonus, then Alice deals
                    4 extra damage to Bob because 2 bonus damage times 2 weapon dice equals 4 
                    total bonus damage.

                    Accuracy is calculated by drawing a line from
                    the center of your hex, to the center of your
                    target. You take a penalty for hexes the line
                    passes through. If the accuracy determined
                    by a path to a target is in question, take the

                    When your hit points drop below 1, your mech is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. 
                    To determine the size of the explosion, add the Generator Level of all of your 
                    generators together.

                    generators (level 1 each), and a Light Hidron unique tertiary generator (level 2).
                    Abby's total generator level is 7. Since Tyler's mech is 3 spaces away, 7 - 3 = 4,

                    is level 7, Charlie is out of the 4 space maximum range for a nuclear explosion's
