                    Play during combat proceeds in turns with one player after another. During 
                    your turn, you may do one of the following five plays: move then attack, 
                    or attack then move, or idle which is neither moving nor attacking. You may
                    also move without attacking or attack without moving. 
                </p>
                <p class="hint">
                    Some tabletop games allow you to split your move action, allowing you to move,
                    then attack, then move again. In Mechanized, this requires a unique subsystem.

                    4 extra damage to Bob because 2 bonus damage times 2 weapon dice equals 4

                    Accuracy is calculated by drawing a line from
                    the center of your hex, to the center of your
                    target. You take a penalty for hexes the line
                    passes through. If the accuracy determined
                    by a path to a target is in question, take the
                    questionable penalties.

                    you cannot shoot through more than 2 pieces of penalizing terrain. Also, you
                    cannot shoot through heavy forest with an additonal terrain penalty. (Terrain
                    penalties are counted up from the enemies hex to the hexes inbetween you)

                    other than moving and shooting.

                <p class="rules">
                    When your hit points drop below 1, your mech is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. 
                    To determine the size of the explosion, add the Generator Level of all of your 
                    generators together. 
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    The maximum distance that a nuclear explosion can deal damage is 4 spaces away 
                    from the epicenter of the explosion.
                </p>
                <p class="hint">
                    Tyler's mech is standing 3 spaces away from Abby's mech when tyler's attack 
                    destroys it. Abby had an Ion generator (level 3), two Phased Ion secondary 
                    generators (level 1 each), and a Light Hidron unique tertiary generator (level 2).
                    Abby's total generator level is 7. Since Tyler's mech is 3 spaces away, 7 - 3 = 4,
                    so Tyler's mech takes 4D4 nuclear damage from the explosion. If Charlie's mech is
                    5 spaces away, Charlie's mech takes no damage at all; even though Abby's generator
                    is level 7, Charlie is out of the 4 space maximum range for a nuclear explosion's 
                    damage.

                <h3>Retreating</h3>
                <p class="rules">
                    A player may decide to retreat from combat rather than fighting it out. To retreat,
                    the player's mech must not have had weapons used on them for the last 5 turns, and 
                    they must be on the edge of the map. 
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    In terms of calculating victory and in determining order for reward cards at the 
                    end of combat, the player's mech that retreated is considered to have been knocked 
                    out of the fight at the time of retreat.
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    Successfuly retreating gives the player an additional +5 credits during the next build phase.
